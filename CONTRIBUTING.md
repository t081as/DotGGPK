## Workflow
Since you do not have write access to the repository a [project forking workflow][20] is used for external contributions:

0. Create a [fork of this project][21] into your own [GitLab workspace][22].
1. Create a feature branch based on the master branch, preferably with the issue number and a description in the name (e.g. `123-my-feature`).
2. Comment the issue you will work on and link your feature branch.
3. Submit a [merge request][23] to the `master` branch using the merge request template; make sure you completed the checklist in the template and mention the issue solved by this merge request to [auto-close][24] it when the branch has been merged. Use the [work in progress][25] indicator while working on the issue.

## Acceptance criteria
- Only submit merge requests for issues tagged as ~accepted
- Obey the StyleCop / CodeAnalysis rules configured in the project solution file
- Write unit tests with a reasonable code coverage
